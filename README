A phase-meter shows the amount of phase difference in a pair of correlated signals. It allows the sound technician to adjust for optimal stereo and to diagnose mistakes such as an inverted signal. Furthermore it provides an indication of mono-compatibility, and possible phase-cancellation that takes place when a stereo-signal is mixed down to mono.
